  Special: Cats going through the AOE of the projectile of this tower will be slowed.
  Description: 'This tower launches itself as a rocket near the cats, slowing all
    cats as they get tempted to rub themselves on it!



    Strengths: AOE Slow
    and distraction!

    Weakness: Only one projectile, slow cooldown, low distraction
    value.


    Cats love scratches and can never say no to them. These scratch-post
    projectiles should keep them pinned on contact!'
